#### Description
This is a mod for Baldur's Gate 3 adding the 2022 Blood Hunter Class by Matthew Mercer.  

#### Overview
I intend to keep this mod as close to the 2022 Blood Hunter rules as possible. There are slight buffs or adjustments where I could not get the skills working RAW. These adjustments, however, I try to keep as close to the power and theme of RAW as possible. You may find some skills have extra/unnecessary properties in some places. This is due to the speed and scale that I approached this with. As time permits, I will review existing skills and try to remove these where possible, however, in most cases, the skills work just fine with these extra parameters.

#### Potential Contributors
As I state above, I intend to keep this implementation as close to RAW as possible, as such, any potential contributors please also try to follow this rule. If there is an issue you encounter, and open a PR to solve, please list any details in the PR that would not be immediately apparent from the changes.
